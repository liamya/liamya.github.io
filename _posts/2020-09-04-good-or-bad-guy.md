Without a doubt, Artificial Intelligence is one of the most discussed topics right now. With the rise of self-driving cars, virtual assistants and even humanoid robots, AI is becoming part of our everyday life. Even though AI is programmed to do something beneficial, many people are afraid of AI and even believe that we are going to die because of it. Opinions are very different and they range from “AI can save our world” to “AI will kill us all”.


In this blog post I will try give answer to the question: “is AI helpful or harmful”. Obviously, there is no way to summarize such a broad topic on just a few pages. That’s why I will focus on my opinion and try keep it short. I also have to mention, that I am still new to this topic, so if there is anything you want to add or you disagree with, I would love to read your opinion in the comments. Most of the sources that I used can be found here: [Discussion paper: Whats wrong with AI?](https://sisr.swissinformatics.org/si-magazine-dirk-helbing-whats-wrong-with-ai-a-discussion-paper/).


On top of that, there will be another part of this blog after my first semester of KI1 – hopefully with more insights! I hope you can enjoy reading the first part!

## "AI is improving at an unpredictable rate"

To get started, we have to consider think about makes people afraid of AI. You have probably seen this scenario in movies, where AI is programmed to do something useful, but is improving so quickly to the point, where it stops listening to humans and silently kills us. 


If you look at past AI systems for playing strategic games, you can tell how much progress has been made in the last 20 years. For instance, Google’s AlphaGo system beat the 18-time world champion Lee Sedol in Go in 2016 - this is about 10 to 20 years earlier than many experts expected this to happen [insert Source]. Since we simply do not know, how fast AI is progressing, being concerned is natural reaction. But it gets even more interesting with AlphaZero, which managed to outperform AlphaGo without human training - only by playing Go against itself.
