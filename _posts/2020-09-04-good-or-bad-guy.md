Without a doubt, Artificial Intelligence is one of the most discussed topics right now. With the rise of self-driving cars, virtual assistants and even humanoid robots, AI is becoming part of our everyday life. Even though AI is programmed to do something beneficial, many people are afraid of AI and even believe that we are going to die because of it. Opinions are very different and they range from “AI can save our world” to “AI will kill us all”.


In this blog post I will try give answer to the question: “is AI helpful or harmful”. Obviously, there is no way to summarize such a broad topic on just a few pages. That’s why I will focus on my opinion and try keep it short. I also have to mention, that I am still new to this topic, so if there is anything you want to add or you disagree with, I would love to read your opinion in the comments. Most of the sources that I used can be found here: [Discussion paper: Whats wrong with AI?](https://sisr.swissinformatics.org/si-magazine-dirk-helbing-whats-wrong-with-ai-a-discussion-paper/).


On top of that, there will be another part of this blog after my first semester of KI1 – hopefully with more insights! I hope you can enjoy reading the first part!

No laudem altera adolescens has, volumus lucilius eum no. Eam ei nulla audiam efficiantur. Suas affert per no, ei tale nibh sea. Sea ne magna harum, in denique scriptorem sea, cetero alienum tibique ei eos. Labores persequeris referrentur eos ei.
