### Intro
Hi there! This will be a continuation of my first blog post where I talked about the question “is AI is harmful or helpful”. You can read the first blog post [here](https://liamya.github.io/).
Let’s review what my first post was about: I concluded that AI becoming evil is not possible. The reason for that is that general artificial intelligence is needed for that scenario. I also concluded that AI only becomes harmful if we humans intentionally make it harmful.
I am writing the second part here after the AI1 course at ZHAW. The question now is: do I still hold the same views as before?
