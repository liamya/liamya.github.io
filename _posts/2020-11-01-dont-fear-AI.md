### Intro
Hi there! This will be a continuation of my first blog post where I talked about the question “is AI is harmful or helpful”. You can read the first blog post [here](https://liamya.github.io/).
Let’s review what my first post was about: I concluded that AI becoming evil is not possible. The reason for that is that general artificial intelligence is needed for that scenario. I also concluded that AI only becomes harmful if we humans intentionally make it harmful.
I am writing the second part here after the AI1 course at ZHAW. 

The question now is: do I still hold the same views as before?

### Evil AI nowhere near
Not too surprisingly, I do still hold the same view: AI will not become evil. Consciousness and human’s thoughts are still not really understandable at the moment. 
The chance that AI will suddenly develop spontaneous malicious intent is therefore not possible at all. From the course I also learnt consciousness does not really matter at all to create intelligent systems. So what else are people afraid of? 

### Generative adversarial network (GAN)
Let me tell you about the generative adversarial networks. I am not an expert in this field but I found this concept quite interesting. I chose this concept because it actually reminds me of the fictional scenario where AI competes against other AI and improve each other during their mutual training.
